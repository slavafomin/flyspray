Provided CSS-file styles the syntax-highlighting of dokuwiki code for the flyspray.

Place "dokuwiki.css" at your theme directory, e.g. at "/themes/CleanFS/".

Open "theme.css" and add the following line to the "IMPORTS" section:
@import url("dokuwiki.css");

Save file and refresh your flyspray page (Ctrl+R, F5).

Alternatively you can just copy the content of "dokuwiki.css" to the end of your "theme.css"-file.
It will perform faster.
